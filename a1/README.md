1) warmup.c
	I run my warmup.c module by first getting inside the working directory where 
	'warmup.c' is saved. Then I type gcc 'warmup.c'  and then type 'a.out'in the 	terminal. Since this file includes two ways of printing 'VICTORY' three times. 	Output would be 
	"VICTORY VICTORY VICTORY" 
	"VICTORY VICTORY VICTORY" 
	
2)rectangle.c
	I run my rectangle.c module by first getting inside the working directory 	where 'rectangle.c' is saved. Then I type gcc 'rectangle.c'  and then type 	'a.out'in the terminal. 
	
	For example: 
	------
	-    -
	------

3)fancy_rectangle.c
	I run my rectangle.c module by first getting inside the working directory 	where 'fancy_rectangle.c' is saved. Then I type gcc 'fancy_rectangle.c' and  	then type 'a.out'in the terminal.
	
	For example:
